<h3>👨🏻‍💻 Marketing Account Manager ➡️ Software Developer</h3>

Hello there, I'm a software developer specializing in JavaScript for full stack applications. My professional background is in marketing, where I have over a decade of progressive experience providing project management, team leadership, and client satisfaction.

I am strategic and highly analytical, with a proven ability to adapt and prioritize in real time. I have a passion for both personal and professional development, and am a strong believer in emotional intelligence. When I'm not `coding`, you can find me fly fishing on the Deschutes or out grabbing a pint at a local brewery. I love making connections in the tech community, so feel free to reach out!

<h3>📈 Professional Competencies</h3>

- **Handling Ambiguity**. I have the ability to push forward with very little (or contradictory) information - not allowing a lack of detailed instruction to hold up an entire project.
- **Project Execution**. As a former project manager, it has become second nature for me to map out the steps of a project, prioritize (and continuously reprioritize) tasks, and coordinate across all available resources to ensure success.
- **Customer Orientation**. My experience as an account manager in the marketing field taught me to ALWAYS advocate for the customer, seeking opportunities for client interaction and feedback.
