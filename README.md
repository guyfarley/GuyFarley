<h3>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª My Journey to Software Development</h3>

A few years ago, I began a journey of introspection to determine the best career path for me. Although I had become quite successful in my marketing career, I was not fulfilled. So I began to explore other paths based on my natural talents and interests. I took note of everything I loved about my marketing roles - and everything I didn't. I explored my values, personality traits, the roles I naturally played on teams, and my ideal work environment. I poured time and energy into what I felt was one of the most important decisions someone can make in life. In the end, I had a short list of potential career paths - and software development sat at the top.

It took a bit longer for me to save the money I needed, to say farewell to my colleagues, and to embark on an accelerated software development program at Code Fellows. Five months later, I graduated with a certificate in **Advanced Software Development with JavaScript** - and absolutely no doubt that I had chosen the right path for me.

I'm beyond excited to continue my journey into this field, and to bring with me all the experience and hard-earned skills of my previous career.
