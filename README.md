<h3>📈 Professional Competencies</h3>

- **Handling Ambiguity**. I have the ability to push forward with very little (or contradictory) information - not allowing a lack of detailed instruction to hold up an entire project.

- **Project Execution**. As a former project manager, it has become second nature for me to map out the steps of a project, prioritize (and continuously reprioritize) tasks, and coordinate across all available resources to ensure success.

- **Customer Orientation**. My experience as an account manager in the marketing field taught me to ALWAYS advocate for the customer, seeking opportunities for client interaction and feedback.
